Commodore User Cheatcards
=========================

Needed :
---
- The 'Commodore User Cheatcards.d64' floppy image
- WinVice
- The original digitized tapes to actually play the game
- Basic understading how everything (linking files in WinVice, loading programs on the C64 etc) works


Needed Optionally :
---
- C64 Studio, if you want to play around with the listings


How To :
---
Start the WinVice emulator and link the original TAP file and the 'Commodore User Cheatcards.d64' 
floppy image. Then, load and run one of the BASIC files from disk. For example 'CU16-PREDATOR'.

Now, just follow the onscreen instructions. It will attempt to load the original game from tape
and after that, you magically have unlimited bullets, unlimited bombs or unlimited lives
depending on the game and the cheat that was available at the time.


C64 Studio :
---
Please open the file 'Commodore User Cheatcards.s64' to work on the project.
It needs C64 Studio version 6.8 or higher and WinVice 3.5 or higher to run.
Open the .s64 file to open the project.


Scanned Cards :
---
I have scanned all the cards(1) and the scans reside in the folder 'Scanned Cards'.
The format if JPEG and the size is 1500 x 2355 pixels scanned at 600 ppi.
Original size : 64 mm wide x 100 mm tall.


Notice :
---
I do not own any of the software and/or listings as they appeared on the back of the Cheatcard.
Just typed them in and tested them for your convenience.




Happy gaming !
